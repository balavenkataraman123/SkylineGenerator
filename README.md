Made this when I was bored in the back of class, was coding, and saw that the thumbnail in the corner of the codebase kinda looked like a cityscape silhouette turned on its side, with many buildings of different heights

I made this in a few minutes and it makes some cool looking stuff

has only one building texture rn so feel free to add more if you dont want it to look all the same like soviet era apartment buildings

I plan to improve this in the future
